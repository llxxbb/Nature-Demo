# A concrete example
At here we would build an Online-Shop based on Nature.  The project will involves order, pay, warehouse and delivery domain. Don't worry about the complexity, we start at simple first, then step by step to achieve the final target. 

Nature have provide all implement for this demo. you will find all of them in the following projects.

- [test entry](https://github.com/llxxbb/Nature-Demo)
- [common defines](https://github.com/llxxbb/Nature-Demo-Common)
- [converter](https://github.com/llxxbb/Nature-Demo-Converter)

For the benefit of the simplicity, here use local-converter to instead of http based converter.
