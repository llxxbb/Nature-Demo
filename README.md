# A concrete example
At here we would build an Online-Shop based on Nature.  The project will involves order, pay, warehouse and delivery domain. Don't worry about the complexity, we start at simple first, then step by step to achieve the final target. 

Nature have provide all implement for this demo. you will find all of them in the following projects.

- [test entry](https://github.com/llxxbb/Nature-Demo)
- [common defines](https://github.com/llxxbb/Nature-Demo-Common)
- [converter](https://github.com/llxxbb/Nature-Demo-Converter)

For the benefit of the simplicity, here use local-converter to instead of http based converter.

If you are the first time to know Nature,  It's best to read it from top to bottom.

In the whole demo description. there are some sections titled with **"Nature key points"** that would mind your attention how to do the thing in Nature way.
