# 统计班内每个人的总分

假设我们已有了一张每个人各科成绩的一张表格，现在对其进行分析统计。首先我们需要一个`成绩单`以存储这张表格。

有了`成绩单`后我们需要有两个维度的统计：学员和学科。我们可以定义两个关系来解决这个问题，但从性能上来讲不是最优的，一是表格数据的多次传递，二是一次扫描就可以得到两个结果而不需要两次扫描。所以我们这里引入了一个新的`Meta`类型:Multi。



## 定义`meta`

```mysql
INSERT INTO meta
(meta_type, meta_key, description, version, states, fields, config)
VALUES('B', 'score/table', 'include part or all students\'s part or all subjects\` score', 1, '', '', '');

INSERT INTO meta
(meta_type, meta_key, description, version, states, fields, config)
VALUES('M', 'score/table', 'include part or all students\'s part or all subjects\` score', 1, '', '', '{"multi_meta":{"keys":["minute","hour"]}, "conflict_avoid": true}');
```

### how to make statistics

状态版本会有很多冲突，导致性能急剧恶化

If we we increase the counter for every order use `state-instance`, there would be many conflicts for high parallel process, and another question is that we would generated great volume of `state-instace`, so it's a terrible thing. 

There is a way to do it is that we count it every minute for minute data and every hour for hour data. to do that we should generate one none state task-instance for every minute and one for every hour. 

### Nature key points

**"M"** `metaType` : express `multi-meta ` which will be processed parallelly, each key is defined in the `multi_meta.keys` property. For this demo, after converted Nature will save two instances.

```
B:statistics/orderTask/minute with para: current minute
B:statistics/orderTask/hour with para: current hour
```

**"conflict_avoid"** setting tell Nature that the same instances will generated many times and Nature should cache it and check it befor save. If `false`(default) is set would lead to a large number of duplicated insertions. so the performance would be very bad.

## Define converter

```mysql
-- orderState:paid --> task
INSERT INTO relation
(from_meta, to_meta, settings)
VALUES('B:sale/orderState:1', 'M:statistics/orderTask:1', '{"selector":{"source_state_include":["paid"]},"executor":[{"protocol":"localRust","url":"nature_demo_executor.dll:statistics_task"}]}');
```



## unready

why delay 70 seconds?

### Questions

There is a question, how to identify each inputted data for `consume/input`? used Nature generated instance id? no, it's hard to query it out, so we use parameterize instance technology in this converter.

update the stateful-counter is a big bottleneck problem for busy system,  so we use Nature's `delay` technology and stateless `meta` to hold every past minute data. You can form you hour data, day data and any wide range data through this mechanism, but in this demo we stopped at minute data, It's enough for you to understand how to use Nature for statistics effectively.

### Nature key points

Another question is how to give multi-dimensions info to the following converter?,  sealed it to the `Instance.content` property? This is not a good idea, because `content`'s structure must be resolved by code! that is not we wanted. `context` will face on this problem. here we just used them in converter settings, no coding! (of course you can use `context` in your code explicitly).



```mysql
-- orderSign --> orderState:signed
INSERT INTO relation
(from_meta, to_meta, settings)
VALUES('B:statistics/consume/input:1', 'B:statistics/consume/product/total/minute:1', '{"target_states":{"add":["signed"]}}');
```
